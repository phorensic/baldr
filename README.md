In Norse mythology Baldr is the God of Light.
He is the shining light entering your refractometer!

This tool helps you convert Brix from your refractometer to Original Gravity, Final Gravity and calculates ABV, Apparent Attenuation, ABW and more.

Baldr is designed to be beautiful, simple, and above all: accurate. Over 6 months in development, it uses the most accurate equations possible from zymologists Sean Terrill and Michael L. Hall.
